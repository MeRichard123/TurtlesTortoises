# TurtlesTortoises

This was one of my first websites when starting out. I buit the original using Adobe Dreamweaver. View the original [here](https://merichard123.github.io/TurtlesTortoises/old/index.html).

This is an improved version I made 3 Years later when I started learning more CSS. This was built using vanilla HTML and CSS

====================

Features:
======

1. Complete lists of all the types of tortoises turtles and sea turtles
2. A care guide resourses section
3. And the part that everyone gets wrong the difference between a turtle and tortoise

====================

Further Imporovements:
===

1. Adding a footer would make it look complete and add some whitespace
2. Images have a hover animation which makes it look clickable so I need to add some links
