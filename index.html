        Why make this page? <br />
        <br />
        I have decided to create this page to inform the world about the amazing
        world of turtles and tortoises and what the difference between them.<br />
        <br />Whats included? <br />
        <br />
        A list of all the types of turtles, tortoises, sea turtles and info
        about them. their anatomy and a care guide. Turtle vs. Tortoise:
        Tortoises and turtles are both reptiles from the order of Testudines,
        but in different classification families. The major difference
        between the two is that tortoises dwell on land, while turtles live in the
        water some or nearly all of the time. A turtle has flipper like feet and
        a tortoise has trunk like legs.<br /><br />keywords and other cool
        facts:

        <strong>What’s the difference between TURTLES & TORTOISES?</strong
        ><br /><br />
        Although they appear to be very similar, there are a number of important
        differences, which set them apart.<br /><br />
        <strong>Turtles</strong><br />
        Spend most of their lives in the water and have webbed feet for
        swimming. Sea turtles for instance almost never leave the ocean, except
        to come ashore to lay eggs. Other turtles live in fresh water ponds and
        lakes. They swim, but they also spend a considerable amount of time on
        shore banks or rocks to bask in the sun. In cold weather, they may
        burrow in the mud, where they go into torpor (a state of decreased
        physiological activity in an animal, including a usually reduced body
        temperature and metabolic rate) until spring and warmer weather returns.
        One species, the Eastern Painted Turtle from North America holds the
        record in the animal kingdom for holding it's breath. While hibernating
        under the ice in winter, this turtle may not take another breath for six
        months!!! It does this by absorbing oxygen from the water through tiny
        blood vessels in it's throat and Cloaca (the opening, or vent at the
        base of the tail).<br /><br /><strong>Tortoises</strong><br />These
        animals cannot swim, they are land-dwellers that eat shrubs, grasses,
        and cactus. Tortoises do not have webbed feet, instead their feet are
        round and stumpy for walking on land. Tortoises living in hot, dry
        habitats use their strong front legs to dig burrows. Then, when it’s too
        hot in the sun, they can cool off underground.<br /><br />There is also
        another shelled species known as the Terrapin These animals split time
        both on land and in water, and always live in areas near water, like
        rivers, ponds, and lakes. Terrapins are often found in brackish, swampy
        areas.
